# AutoSalesReports
Utilizing the Caspio cloud based development environment I designed, coded, tested and rolled-out AutoSalesReports (ASR). ASR is a cloud based BI solution for the Australian automotive industry.  ASR is a fully integrated CRM and Saleslog system, with advanced BI reporting capabilities. Microsoft SQL Server was used as the cloud database. Extensive Java scripting was used to facilitate a large portion of ASR's functionality in Caspio.
